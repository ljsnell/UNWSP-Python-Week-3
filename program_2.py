# Write a program that asks the user to enter a person's age.  The program should display a message indicating whether the person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult.  Following are the guidelines:

# If the person is 1 year old or less, it should display "infant" (without quotes).
# If the person is older than 1 year, but younger than 13 years, it should display "child".
# If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, it should display "teenager".
# If the person is at least 20 year old, it should display "adult".
